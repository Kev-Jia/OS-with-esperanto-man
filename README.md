# Custom OS (doesn't have a name yet)
## Please do not use this OS (especially on real hardware--I do not know if it will break it or not). It's awful and will only get more awful as time goes on.

# Compilation instructions
## Dependencies
`clang` (or i686-elf cross-compiler, using which would require changes to the Makefile)  
`nasm`  
`qemu-system-i386 (qemu-system-x86)` (not required, but run by default in the Makefile)  

## Compilation
Download the files and run make.
