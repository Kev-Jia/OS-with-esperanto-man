# Custom OS (doesn't have a name yet)
## Please do not use this OS (especially on real hardware--I do not know if it will break it or not). It's awful and will only get more awful as time goes on.

# Compilation instructions
## Dependencies
`clang` (or i686-elf cross-compiler--requires changes to the Makefile)

`qemu` (not required, but run by default in the Makefile)

## Compilation
